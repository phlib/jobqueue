All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Added `BatchableJobQueueInterface` which defines a JobQueue capable of putting jobs to a queue in batches.
  - Extends `JobQueueInterface`.
  - Adds `putBatch()` method, which accepts an array of `JobInterface` and returns `self`.
- Added `BatchableSchedulerInterface` which defines a scheduler capable of retrieving and removing jobs in batches.
  - Extends `SchedulerInterface`.
  - Adds `retrieveBatch()` which will return a array of jobs or `false` if there are no jobs.
  - Adds `removeBatch()` which accepts an array of job ids and returns a bool to indicate success.
### Changed
- `Phlib\JobQueue\AwsSqs\JobQueue` supports batching and implements `BatchableJobQueueInterface`.
- `Phlib\JobQueue\Scheduler\DbScheduler` supports batching and implements `BatchableSchedulerInterface`.
- `Phlib\JobQueue\Scheduler\DbScheduler` optionally accepts a `skipLocked` argument to indicate whether locked rows should be skipped when claiming jobs.  Enabling this will reduce the risk of deadlocks occurring when running multiple instances of the monitor.
  This defaults to `false` if not provided and should only be enabled if you are running MySQL 8.0.1 or higher.
- `Phlib\JobQueue\Scheduler\DbScheduler` optionally accepts a `batchSize` argument to specify how many jobs should be fetched per query.
  This defaults to `50` if not provided.
- `Phlib\JobQueue\Scheduler\DbScheduler` optionally accepts a `backoff` argument which should be a `STS\Backoff\Backoff` object used to retry if a deadlock occurs.
  This defaults to `null` and no retry will be attempted if not provided.
- `MonitorCommand` will fetch jobs in batches if the scheduler implements `BatchableSchedulerInterface`.
- `MonitorCommand` will put jobs in batches if the JobQueue implements `BatchableJobQueueInterface` and the scheduler support batching.

## [2.0.0] - 2022-09-14
### Added
- Add support for PHP v8
- Type declarations have been added to all properties, method parameters and
  return types where possible.
### Changed
- Improve worker command handling exceptions from job queue library.
- Worker command error log context keys changed to use `camelCase`.
- **BC break**: Make return types consistent for `JobQueueInterface` methods.
  - `put()` returns self. A job delayed in the DB used to return `true`,
    otherwise Beanstalk used to return a Beanstalkd job ID.
  - `retrieve()` returns `null` when not found. Beanstalk used to return `false`.
  - `markAsComplete()`, `markAsIncomplete()` and `markAsError()` return self.
    AWS returned void. Beanstalk sometimes returned the underlying connection.
- **BC break**: Wrap exceptions from SQS in package exception classes.
  If an implementation was catching `SqsException` it should now catch a
  `Phlib\JobQueue\Exception` class instead.
### Removed
- **BC break**: Removed support for PHP versions <= v7.3 as they are no longer
  [actively supported](https://php.net/supported-versions.php) by the PHP project

## [1.1.1] - 2018-11-15

### Added
- Added implementation of AWS SQS queue using SDK.

## [1.0.1] - 2017-06-13
